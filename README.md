About 
=====

This repo is an applicatation and logic behind a variation of the Breath First Search alogorithm in *C++*. 

What it includes:
-----------------

This implementation uses **std::queue** to:
1. Traverse
2. Store 
3. And finally print 

This will occur to each node within the tree until all of the branches of the node has been touched!

With this implementation of BFS, now included will be a destructor for the binary tree!!
